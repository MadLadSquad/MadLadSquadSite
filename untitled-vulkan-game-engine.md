The UntitledVulkanGameEngine project is our custom general purpose game engine made in C++. Our goal is to make an easy to use, high performance, moddable
game engine that can be used for both 3D and 2D games.

We curently have a stable scripting API, a stable editor UI, somewhat stable C and C++ modding and plugins API and a somewhat stable Vulkan renderer.

In the rendering and tools department we currently lack:
1. 2D, 3D animations and an Animation editor
1. Particle systems and effects
1. A physics engine
1. Sprites and sprite sheet editor
1. Production asset archives
1. PBR shading
1. Batch rendering
1. Post-processing
1. Scene text rendering
1. Multi-threading
1. Cinematics
1. AO
1. Normal maps
1. Parallax maps
1. Light maps
1. Blending and transparency
1. Cube maps
1. HDR
1. Bloom
1. Gamma correction
1. Frustrum culling
1. Cascaded shadow maps
1. Tesselation
1. Networking

Most of the features listed here will be ready for version 1.0 when it drops sometime in 2025. Development of these features will begin in 2023 as we're
currently preparing for the release of Alpha 1.0 of the game engine, as well as the release of a number of applications part of the UntitledDesktop
project, which unfortunately has a lot of overlap with the engine
