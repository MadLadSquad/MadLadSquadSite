# The MadLadSquad code of conduct
The MadLadSquad code of conduct defines a bunch of reasonable rules to follow.

## Part 1: Obligations on the part of MadLadSquad to respect freedoms
In this chapter we will discuss a list of obligations that MadLadSquad takes on to restrict certain types of discussions that restrict freedom on our
platforms

1. Freedom of expression
   1. We believe in almost absolute freedom of discussion with the exception of some cases namely:
      - NSFW content
      - Illegal content
      - More to be added if needed
   1. You are responsible for other users' responses to your own messages and your PR is your responsibility
   1. Certain provisions on freedom of discussion in our own platforms can be found in the list below:
      - MadLadSquad and its related projects respect freedom and shall not be political. For example we shall not make applications related to a political
        topic. As of the writing of this it's October 21st 2022. 
      
        Currently there are multiple global conflicts happening, the war in Ukraine, the border clashes on the Armenia-Azerbaijan border, the 
        Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan border clashes and more. We can also take events like the BLM protests, the COVID-19 pandemic and more from past years.
      
        These events even though mentioned here are not related in any way to the development of the software
        and discussing them or events similar to them in any way is unproductive and generally unneeded. 
        
        Here is an example of what we will not do using the examples listed above:
         1. We will not add links to any of our projects for supporting Ukraine
         1. We will not create applications related to a political topic i.e. COVID-19 information and tracking applications
         1.  We also reserve the right to limit discussions to be outside the scope of politics. This COC exists for that very reason. If you're reading 
             this and agree with it, then you can contribute and no more discussion can be had. If you don't agree with this you have the freedom to 
             use the software either way, but you do not have the right to organize mobs to reinstate political discussions on our discussion platforms
         1. Additionally we will not promote political organizations and movements like BLM and political ideologies. We shall only support organizations
            that support us and that we agree with. You can read further on our values and how we conduct discussions
      - Keep discussions civil, do not organize unneeded violence using mobs to get your point across, instead organize a simple vote. And depending on
        the moderator team's decisions we will show our opinion and work to accept or reject the vote, simple as that.
