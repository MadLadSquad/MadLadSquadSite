2021 is a year of unprecedented growth for MadLadSquad. The UntitledVulkanGameEngine(UVK for short) jumps form pre-alpha 0.1.0.0 to pre-alpha 0.9.0.0 in the span of a year. Most code there is from that period(especially in the UI department)

Additionally projects like the UntitledVulkanTerminalEmulator were started

Late December 2021 also marks the creation of the UntitledLinuxGameManager. Together with the terminal emulator they form the base for the UntitledDesktopEnvironment of 2022
