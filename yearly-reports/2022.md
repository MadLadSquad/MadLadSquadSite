2022 marks a large slowdown in development due to personal issues with Madman10K.

Besides that the Alpha 1.0 version of the UntitledVulkanGameEngine was released in December 2022 making it the first MadLadSquad application to hit 1.0 other than the discord bot

On June 20th the UntitledDesktopEnvironment project was started. Its goal is to create a fully featured and functional derktop environment for X, Wayland and even Windows

Alpha 1.0 of the UntitledImGuiFramework launched which allows us to make modular desktop applications

The full 1.0 releases of UntitledTextEditor, UntitledFilesystem, UntitledDynamicLibraryLoader, UntitledExec, the full rewrite of UVKBuildTool, the 1.0 release of UVKShaderCompiler,
UntitledLinuxGameManager, the creation of the automatic dependency update system and the support of i18n in [Funtoo linux](https://funtoo.org) were all massive achievements for the year.

2022 was a transitional year to get the base Desktop stable and other project out of the way, as to make path for 2023, the year of the desktop.

As of the writing of this page 2023 is planned to facilitate the overall growth of the DE and possibly MadLadSquad, our plans are to get either half the DE at 1.0 or the whole desktop at comparable alpha stages
