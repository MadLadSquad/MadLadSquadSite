# About us
We're a decentralized team of developers, working on a wide variety of software, with the goal of redefining the desktop 
experience. We have 2 main departments:
1. The games department - Responsible for our games and game related products like the UntitledVulkanGameEngine
1. The desktop department - Responsible for maintaining the UntitledDesktopEnvironment
1. The multilingual department - Responsible for working on human language tools

## Games
In the game development field we create open source, highly moddable games. We prioritize player experience and we encourage all 
our players to work together with us in creating great digital experiences.

Our technology stack is cross-platform and is almost completely self-sustained. We use our own in-house technology like the 
[UntitledVulkanGameEngine](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledVulkanGameEngine) to
have full control over our games' backend. But we also work with industry standard technologies like the Unreal Engine, it all 
depends on the requirements of the project.

## The UntitledDesktopEnvironment
The [UntitledDesktopEnvironment](https://madladsquad.com/desktop) is a suite of applications forming the 
UntitledDesktopEnvironment. We have an almost complete list of applications we're working on that contains the core and even some 
more features a modern desktop environment would provide.

More info can be found [here](https://madladsquad.com/desktop).

## Multilingual
The multilingual department works on a small number of applications in the areas of language learning, input and output. 
While they work on standalone applications like [Youyin](https://youyin.madladsquad.com/) the multilingual team mainly 
helps the [multilingual project](https://madladsquad.com/untitled-desktop/subprojects/i18n) under the desktop department.
Additionally, work on the multilingual project gets frequently backported to the games department. Here are some of the tasks of 
the multilingual department:
1. Develop language learning applications like [Youyin](https://youyin.madladsquad.com/)
1. Help with translating all softwar we produce to multiple languages
1. Help with developing libraries related to multilingual support, such as ones that deal with system fonts, locales, translation systems and more
1. Help the [multilingual project](https://madladsquad.com/untitled-desktop/subprojects/i18n) with tools for the UntitledDesktopEnvironment
