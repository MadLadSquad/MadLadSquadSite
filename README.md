# About us
We're a decentralized team of developers working on many different types of software with the goal of redefining the desktop experience. We have 2 main
departments:
1. The games department - Responsible for our games and game related products like the UntitledVulkanGameEngine
1. The desktop department - Responsible for maintaining the UntitledDesktopEnvironment

## Games
In the game development field we create open source, highly moddable games. We prioritize player experience and we encourage all our players to work
together with us in creating great digital experiences.

Our technology stack is cross-platform and is almost completely self-sustained. We use our own in-house technology like the UntitledVulkanGameEngine to
have full control over our games' backend. But we also work with indurstry standard technologies like the Unreal Engine, it all depends on the requirements
of the project.

## The UntitledDesktoEnvironment
The UntitledDesktopEnvironment is a suite of applications forming the UntitledDesktopEnvironment. We have an almost complete list of applications we're
working on that contains the core and even some more features a modern desktop environment would provide.

The idea for the UntitledDesktopEnvironment is to create a DE that is fully compatible with other ones like Gnome and KDE. We're extensively analysing
their user facing APIs and creating bridges that make the using the linux desktop a pleasant experience.
