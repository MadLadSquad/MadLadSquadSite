In this page we are going to detail some of the features and plans for our desktop envirionment, we hope that this page can clear up any questions on
what we desire to achieve with this project

## Motivation
Our motivation is simple, create a great desktop environment for Linux and other operating systems running components made by the 
[freedesktop foundation](https://freedesktop.org)

But beyond that, why are we creating it in the first place and what are the problems we want to fix. But before that let's start with a quick overview of 
why the FOSS desktop has problems. Most applications have a problem with communicating with one another. The main issue causing this is that 
Unix based OS' architectures don't feature the desktop as an essential component since their architecture was developed way before the concept of GUI 
applications became a thing. 

Because of this the GUI became a thing for third parties, and as a result of this we don't have the same uniformity as systems like
Windows, MacOS or even Android flavours. This all negatively impacts UX and unfortunately is not a fixable issue, fortunately shells
like Gnome and KDE, have for the most part removed most problems to date and the UX is definitely a great one over there.

So why even consider UDE when you said that KDE and Gnome are great ðŸ˜‚. Well here's the thing, we're actually not trying to compete with them, all we
want to create is an alternative desktop experience. Here are our priorities:
1. Freedom
1. Cross-desktop compatibility
1. A fully community-centered approach to development
1. A uniform experience or as close as we can get to it
1. A user experience no matter your level of knowledge
1. A fully modifiable and hackable application suite out of the box
1. Even more small things such as great multilingual experience

We will cover all of those points in the headers below

## Freedom
We want the user to have full freedom in whatever applications they want to use, and to give this freedom without impacting the approximately good UX

What do we mean by this? A user shall have the ability to
1. Replace the desktop widgets system(i.e. wallpaper manager, status bar), applications, libraries, etc. and the system should work normally. The 
environment shall not be a monolith that breaks on the removal of any applications, regardless of how large or small it is
1. Use any configuration format, library and/or programming language they want in configuring their programs
1. The user shall have full conscious choice on all features he/she wants and shall be able to completely control which components get installed
1. The user shall have the freedom to modify every application he/she desires in an easy manner using plugins that don't discriminate against the 
programming language, configuration format or general technology the user deems fit for the job
1. Developers shall be freed from a pendantic environment where the DE developers force a certain style, toolkit and rules on developers

### Configurability
We want the user to have freedom, and this cannnot be done without the ability of the user to easily configure their system and applicaiton in whatever
way they desire. Here is what we provide with our applications:
1. A standard C and C++ API for all applications that can benefit from it, so that a user can make a plugin using bindings for another programming
language or use a plugin that provides a runtime environment in the case of a scripting language. The intention is to let the users use 
whatever technologies they want and not force them use a single programming language for development of plugins. We think that this positively 
impacts our user experience, not only because advanced users can feel right at home by using whatever tools they want, but also because a larger number 
of advanced users can develop plugins, making the plugin ecosystem richer and therefore the end user experience better
1. Every application is a self-sustained atom, meaning that it can be swapped out with some other application at any time without breaking the system
1. Cross-format and cross-desktop compatibility so that users can easily convert their old configs into our ecosystem, or vice versa, 
without having to manually tinker for hours or even days rewriting the same config in a different way of format
1. Compile flags that can be used by the user to enable or disable any additional features. This is important because it provides
minimalist users with the option to have a minimal environment. The benefits of minimalism are many including less bugs and higher security, but we cannot
discuss all of them here

## Cross-desktop compatibility
What we mean by cross-desktop compatibility is: paradigms and components made for desktops such as Gnome and KDE, shall have the ability to work
effordlessly on our system. This includes things such as:
1. Having converters for config files, plugins, themes, etc.
1. Listening for signals from dbus and responding to them appropriately
1. Not creating pedantic design policies and requirements
1. Adapting our system to their user-facing APIs

This section will be expanded to be more detailed soon!

## A fully community-centered approach to development
We want our community to control the direction of our projects, that's why we distribute our software as open source, but that isn't the full picture

Our collaboration workflow is the following:
1. Make an issue
1. Submit a pr if needed or if ready
1. Maintainers review the code
1. If the review is successful, pre-pr merge discussion starts, mainly who is going to maintain the code or how it's going to be maintained
1. In the end the PR gets merged

We also have a bunch of roles we have as well as responsibilities:
1. Project manager
   - Basically a god title that has responsibility for keeping the scope of the project managing feature decisions and more. Is responsible for and works
     on the tasks taken by the lower tiers. So basically responsible for everything and can take over at any moment
3. Maintainer
   - Fixing bugs
   - Reviewing PRs
   - Keeping backwards compatibility
4. Developer
   - Implementing new features
   - Merging and integrating feature PRs if needed
   - Helping maintainers deal with new features
5. Contributor
   - Code contributors
     - Contribute code for whatever reason, be it feature request or bug fixes
   - Docs contributors
     - Contribute to the documentation in either the code or the document format
     - Create educational resources for other users
     - Help developers with learning how to use the software
   - Translation contributors
     - Contributes translations to the docs, to applications and everything we can m18nise
   - Plugin contributors
     - Help maintain a beautiful C and C++ APIs for plugins in our applications
   - Art and asset contributors
     - Help design icons, art, 3D models, sound effects and more things that need to be included into our applications
   - Misc contributors
     - For everything else we didn't mention
6. Observer
   - This is a specific role for developers and maintainers that don't necessarily work full time on the project, but that have a lot of experience with it
   and can help at any time when an emergency occurs

Please do note that these roles are there for semantic reason, you can freely assign yourself any of the contributor roles, and you can switch from any
higher role to an equivalent or lower role. You do need official promotion from the desktop team to get to any of the top 3 roles
