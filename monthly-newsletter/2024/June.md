### Starting work on the UntitledImGuiFileBrowser
[Nick](https://github.com/fami-fish) started work on the [UntitledImGuiFileBrowser](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledImGuiFileBrowser), a general usage file browser for dear imgui.

This widget will be used as a base for develogin the [UntitledFileManager](https://github.com/UntitledFileManager), a cross-platform, featureful, file manager application.

## Misc projects
### UntitledFlipperZero 1.0
We wanted to create a to-do list application for the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one), so we decided to write a C++ library on top of
the C GUI API. The library is called [UntitledFlipperZero](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledFlipperZero). It is relatively thin abstraction layer that allows you to write complex user interfaces with up to 3x less LoC.

### FlipperTasks 1.0
[FlipperTasks](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/FlipperTasks) is our first application for the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one). You can download it from the Flipper Apps Catalogue, [here](https://lab.flipper.net/apps/tasks).

## Organisation
### New hardware
The organisation is now owns a MacBook, which will allow us to finally port all applications to macOS and other platforms.
