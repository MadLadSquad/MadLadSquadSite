Work on release 0.9.9.0 has started. It's headline feature is the 1.0 release of the 
[UntitledFontUtils](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledFontUtils) library, which powers the fonts submodule of the OS module.

Additionally, much of the feature set for 1.0 is done, except for some annoying bugs that are hard to debug and some other small features.

### UntitledFontUtils 1.0
The long-awaited [UntitledFontUtils](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledFontUtils) library is finally ready for 1.0 for the 0.9.9.0
release of the [UntitledImGuiFramework](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledImGuiFramework).

It adds support for fetching default system fonts in a cross-platform manner.

### UntitledLog 5.0
