Welcome to the May 2024 monthly newsletter.

## UntitledDesktop
### UntitledImGuiFramework 0.8.7.9
New improvements to upstream libraries and the UVKBuildTool now allow for distributing the framework as a package for ports-based
systems, such as Gentoo ebuilds.

### UntitledDesktopOverlay
Following the improvements in UntitledImGuiFramework 0.8.7.9, all MadLadSquad applications and libraries can be found as Funtoo &
Gentoo packages under the [UntitledDesktopOverlay](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledDesktopOverlay). Funtoo users have
access to YAML and python autogens for all the packages in the overlay.

Other package managers will get support soon.
