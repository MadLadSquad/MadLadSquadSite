Welcome to the March 2024 montly newsletter.

## Modus Mio BG
### SpotifyUtilities
We created a new GitHub repository called [SpotifyUtilities](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/SpotifyUtilities). It stores all scripts related to generating Spotify data for Modus Mio BG posts such as the top artists
list.

A new script was also added that gets the release dates of every album/EP from the artists in the artists list and adds its birthday to an [iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) file that can be 
imported in most calendar applications.

## Bulgar3D
We have made steady progress in exploring the capabilities of our machine and we're glad to announce that we're starting to sell 3D printed models on [our Instagram page](https://instagram.com/bulgar3d). We will
introduce a website later this year with a community marketplace and much more.
