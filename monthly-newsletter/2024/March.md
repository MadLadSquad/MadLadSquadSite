Welcome to the March 2024 montly newsletter.

### SpotifyUtilities
We created a new GitHub repository called [SpotifyUtilities](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/SpotifyUtilities). It stores all 
scripts related to generating Spotify data for Modus Mio BG posts such as the top artists list.

A new script was also added that gets the release dates of every album/EP from the artists in the artists list and adds its 
birthday to an [iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) file that can be imported in most calendar applications.

### Progress on the character editor
Nick has made a lot of progress on our fork of the [make-me-a-hanzi](https://github.com/skishore/make-me-a-hanzi) tool. Mainly,
we're getting closer to being able to subdivide SVGs in the editor so that errors can be minimised. Screenshots:

## Bulgar3D
We have made steady progress in exploring the capabilities of our machine and we're glad to announce that we're starting to sell 
3D printed models on [our Instagram page](https://instagram.com/bulgar3d). We will introduce a website later this year with a
community marketplace and much more.
