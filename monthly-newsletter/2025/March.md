### UntitledImGuiFramework 1.0
The [UntitledImGuiFramework](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledImGuiFramework)'s 1.0 release has finally released.

For the occasion, we also hired [insekhta](https://www.instagram.com/_.insekhta._/)
to make a logo for it:

Now that the 1.0 release is done, we are putting a soft freeze of new features until the end of May, due to the need to focus on other
projects, as well as to iron out any existing bugs in post-1.0 patches.
