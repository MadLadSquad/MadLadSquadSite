### UntitledImGuiFramework
In July we're planning on releasing releases 1.3 and 1.4 of the 
[UntitledImGuiFramework](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledImGuiFramework).

They will contain the following:

1. Release 1.3 depends on the [UImGuiRendererExamples](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UImGuiRendererExamples) library to be finished so that
   final testing of the pluggable renderer API can be done
1. Release 1.4 marks our move from GLFW to SDL3. Remaining tasks:
   - Redesign the internal window class to use SDL3
   - Rework the entire input system and interface around SDL3
   - Rework the Window interface for SDL3
   - Apply SDL3 improvements(DPI scaling, copy/paste in WASM, IME hints, etc)
   - Document the move to SDL3
  
## pkggen
THe development of [pkggen](https://pkggen.madladsquad.com) will begin around the end of the month.
