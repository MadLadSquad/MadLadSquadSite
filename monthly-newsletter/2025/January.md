Welcome to the January 2025 edition of the monthly newsletter.

## Heapforge and MadLadSquad
In the [last edition of the monthly newsletter](https://madladsquad.com/monthly-newsletter/2024/December), we mentioned the split of MadLadSquad into 2 entities. We are proud to announce that most of the administrative work
needed for setting up Heapforge is now done.

By the end of January 2025, you can expect our new logo, and possibly website.

## UntitledDesktop
### UntitledImGuiFramework 0.9.9.7
Due to a lot of recent changes to the [UntitledImGuiFramework](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledImGuiFramework)'s code, but our inability to finish the new directory-independent [UVKBuildTool](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UVKBuildTool)
in a timely manner, we have decided to skip 8 proper point releases for the middle of January release. With this release basically every feature is finished with the exception of integrating the 
[UntitledFontUtils](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledFontUtils) library.

### UntitledDBusUtils 1.3 & 1.4
The 1.3 and 1.4 releases of the [UntitledDBusUtils](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledDBusUtils) library fix 2 major bugs with the library and its integration with our applications.

### cimgui_extra 2.1 & 2.2
The 2.1 & 2.2 releases of the [cimgui_extra](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/cimgui-extra) library add updates to the C APIS that conform with the latest versions of the underlying C++ implementations.

### UntitledLog 6.0
The 6.0 release of [UntitledLog](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledLog) adds the ability to disable logging at any point if needed.

### UntitledFontUtils 0.5
The initial 0.5 release of [UntitledFontUtils](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledFontUtils) will be ready by the end of January.

### pkggen development
The development of [pkggen](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/pkggen) is set to begin after the 1.0 release of the [UntitledImGuiFramework](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledImGuiFramework).
