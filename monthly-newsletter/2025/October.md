Welcome to the October 2025 edition of the monthly newsletter.

## UntitledImGuiFramework 2.0
Due to an expansion in scope, the 2.0 release of the [UntitledImGuiFramework](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledImGuiFramework) needed to
be delayed by 3 weeks. The new release date for 2.0 is the 10th of October.

The new features as part of this release are:

1. CMake improvements:
   - General cleanups and refactoring
   - Split platform-dependent code to platform-specific backends
   - Info.plist files used when exporting as macOS application bundles are now generated by CMake
1. Packaged the framework and our applications as deb packages. More information on: <https://debs.madladsquad.com>
1. Client-side bars and menu builders:
   - Added better integration between these 2 features
   - Added support for native-looking client-side bars on macOS
1. Streamlined multiple framework interfaces
1. Fixed irregular naming and functionality conventions for some window attributes
1. Added additional functions that were previously missing for accessing some window attributes
1. Fixed weird OpenGL crash on Wayland
1. Added additional RendererUtils functions for window and renderer integration
1. Added new WindowUtils interface for integrating with the underlying windowing systems's events API
1. Added additional functions to the window interface's platform section for better native integration
1. Refactored the general file structure of the `Framework` folder
1. Introduced the pluggable windowing system
1. Created a built-in GLFW windowing backend
1. Created an SDL backend named [UImGuiSDL](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UImGuiSDL)

After the 2.0 release of the framework we will be shifting focus to other applications. We think that we fully completed all our initial
goals for the framework which means that there will be no major new features for the most part. Further on, we'll be focusing on the
following aspects:

1. Feature requests from new users
1. Fixing bugs
1. Keeping it compatible with new versions of our dependencies
1. Adding support for new operating system releases
1. Working on a better testing workflows
1. Maintaining related libraries such as [UImGuiSDL](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UImGuiSDL) and
   [UImGuiRendererExamples](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UImGuiRendererExamples)
1. Creating new applications with, and finding new use cases for the framework

Development until the end of 2025 will mainly be shifting to [pkggen](https://pkggen.madladsquad.com).

## pkggen
Due to our slower progress with other tasks as described above we were unable to release release 0.4 by the end of September. We're
expecting that we will introduce at least releases 0.2 and 0.3 by the end of October, with 0.4 and 0.5 coming in November.

As a reminder the pkggen release cycle up to 1.0 will be the following:

1. Release 0.1(October):
   - Complete GitHub generator
   - Complete URL generator
   - Generator middleware and custom generators
1. Release 0.2(October):
   - Support for Gentoo ebuilds
1. Release 0.3(October):
   - Support for Arch Linux pkgbuilds
1. Release 0.4(October/early November):
   - Support for RPM packages
1. Release 0.5(November)
   - Support for deb packages
1. Release 0.6(November/December):
   - Testing generators for Linux
   - Testing generators for Arch pkgbuilds
   - Testing generators for RPM
   - Testing generators for Gentoo ebuilds
   - Testing generator middleware and custom generators
1. Release 0.7(December)
   - Testing generators for macOS
1. Release 0.8(December/January)
   - Testing generators for Windows
1. Release 0.9(February)
   - Deployment generators for each packaging format
1. Release 1.0
   - Overall polishing, improvements and wider deployment

## Handwriting
Our current site for handwriting is far from 1.0-ready. After the release of pkggen 1.0, we're planning on returning to this project and
upgrading many of its systems, such as:

1. Creating a better character database
1. Introducing better UI
1. First-launch tutorial setup
1. Accounts and cloud sync
1. A leadearboard system
1. Multiple gamification systems(streak counters, levels, badges, leaderboard flags)
1. Offline play
  
## Sleep app
While we're preparing pkggen for 1.0, we're planning on releasing a small mobile and desktop application which we're currently calling the
sleep app(not really imaginative but gets the point across). The idea is to create mobile and desktop applications that are installed on
all of the user's personal devices. This app will then keep track of whether you're online on any of your devices before or after a bed
time goal you have set. The idea of the app is to make it easy for a person to gradually transition away from a night owl lifestyle, which
is proven to be detrimental to a person's health.

We're planning on releasing apps for:

1. 2025:
   - Android
   - iOS/iPadOS
   - Windows
   - Linux
   - macOS
1. 2026+
   - Integration with watchOS
   - Integration with WearOS
   - Integration with the user's physical activity(avoiding distracting the user when they drive, etc)
