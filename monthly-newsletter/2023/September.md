### Working on Youyin 1.0
We have a new vision for implementing the 1.0 release of Youyin and are starting development in September. Some features that will
release in September are:

1. Phrase support

Work on adding more writing systems to the character database also started. [Zhuyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo)
is the first writing system we decided to add and data for most characters in it can already be used on the website.

Additionally, development of the future backend, account system and more have started. Once we reach a good enough point, we will
launch the whole service at once.

### UntitledI18N 1.0
We plan on releasing the 1.0 release of the UntitledI18N library this month. It will mainly deal with translating strings in our
applications, however more features could be added in further releases.

The library will be integrated into the web module of the [UVKBuildTool](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UVKBuildTool), which will
enable us to easily generate translations of our websites.
