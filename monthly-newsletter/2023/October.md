Welcome to the October 2023 edition of the monthly newsletter.

## MadLadSquad backend work
We're continuing to develop the MadLadSquad backend, which is going to be used by [Youyin](https://youyin.madladsquad.com) and other websites.

## Youyin 0.2.2 & 0.3
In October, we will also release the 0.2.2 and 0.3 releases of Youyin. 

The 0.2.2 release fixes many UI/UX bugs and issues. Because most of our websites borrow styles from Youyin this will also impact them.

Meanwhile, the 0.3 release will add support for phrases. It is expected to land by the end of the month.

## UVKBuildTool 2.0
The new version of the [UVKBuildTool](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UVKBuildTool) now adds support for localising 
web applications using the [UntitledI18N](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledI18N) library and translation format.

## UntitledI18N 1.2
Fixes multiple high-severity bugs in [UntitledI18N](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledI18N).

## Youyin 0.4
Uses the new [UVKBuildTool](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UVKBuildTool) 2.0 to provide translations in Bulgarian. The site will soon be translated into other languages. 

# Misc
Contrary to popular belief, MadLadSquad is simply an organisation for volunteer projects. Because of this, our projects may not always be
related to software.

## Announcing Modus Mio BG
Fans of German hip-hop may be familiar with the popular [Modus Mio](https://www.instagram.com/modusmio/) playlist. It's a playlist 
maintained by [Spotify.de](https://spotify.de). Every Friday, new Deutschrap releases get added to it. They also utilise social media
marketing through their [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/modusmio/), to get more people to listen to the playlist, therefore
earning Spotify more users.

While we're not related to Spotify, we saw the effects Modus Mio had on the German hip-hop industry, and we decided to create our own
page for Bulgarian hip-hop. We also decided to add electronic music into the mix.

You can check out the playlist on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5GZFyyJHwjDNvffn6H18Qv) and our 
[Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/modusmio.bg/).

You can also check out our up-to-date Bulgarian rappers list [here](https://madladsquad/modus-mio-artists).

Also, we want to thank [insekhta](https://www.instagram.com/_.insekhta._/), for designing the playlist logo and other images:
