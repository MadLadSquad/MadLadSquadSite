## MadLadSquad backend work
We're continuing to develop the MadLadSquad backend, which is going to be used by [Youyin](https://youyin.madladsquad.com) and other websites.

## Announcing BGKS
We're announcing [BGKS](https://bgks.madladsquad.com), a website for correcting incorrect grammar, spelling and punctuation. It works by using
a database of extracts from literature in a given language. Using these extracts, tests are generated, where the user has to input the
correct form of the word they want to learn.

Additionally, we have added a punctuation mode that will require the user to input a punctuation character in all spaces between words.

Beta 0.1 should be available around the beginning of November 2023.

## Announcing LitTok
We're announcing [LitTok](https://littok.madladsquad.com), a website for reading books and other types of literature in a TikTok-like format.

Beta 0.1 should be available around the beginning of January 2024.

# Misc
Contrary to popular belief, MadLadSquad is simply an organisation for volunteer projects. Because of this, our projects may not always be
related to software.

## Announcing Modus Mio BG
Fans of German hip-hop may be familiar with the popular [Modus Mio](https://www.instagram.com/modusmio/) playlist. It's a playlist 
maintained by [Spotify.de](https://spotify.de). Every Friday, new Deutschrap releases get added to it. They also utilise social media
marketing through their [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/modusmio/), to get more people to listen to the playlist, therefore
earning Spotify more users.

While we're not related to Spotify, we saw the effects Modus Mio had on the German hip-hop industry and we decided to create our own
page for Bulgarian hip-hop. We also decided to add electronic music into the mix.

You can check out the playlist on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5GZFyyJHwjDNvffn6H18Qv) and our 
[Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/modusmio.bg/).

You can also check out our up to date Bulgarian rappers list [here](https://madladsquad/modus-mio-artists).
