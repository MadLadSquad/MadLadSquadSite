### Celebrating 100 followers
On the 10th of December we managed to climb to 100 followers on Instagram. 12 days later, we're at 116 so as you can see, we're growing by about a follower a day,
which is a good growth direction.

### New content
In December we released a vote on the album/EP of the month. Additionally, we now allow for artists to add us as collaborators if they want to advertise on the page.

Additionally, we started voting songs using Instagram Music, instead of just sharing a spotify card. We also developed some art for song votes:

Finally, we're developing new content strategy for Instagram Reels, which will be deployed by the beginning of January.

## MadLadSquad update
It's rare that we actually announce an organisational update, but here we go.

### New hardware
We got some new hardware at MadLadSquad: [Stanislav Vasilev(Madman10K)](https://i-use-gentoo-btw.com) bought a 3D printer.

We will use this to develop some new business ventures, that will hopefully generate us some good revenue.

### Incorporating
In 2024, we're planning to finally incorporate MadLadSquad as a for-profit LLC, registered in Bulgaria(part of the EEA). We're planning to start this process somewhere in June
or July.
